You don’t want to cook and eat your audience, you want them to become converting customers.\n\n<P>When we blueprint an area, we’re not building physical infrastructure. Rather, we’re building an informational infrastructure. This means we can know exactly when someone is within walking distance of your business, entering your building, or even at a competitor’s place of business.

<p>To keep the analogy going; if classic digital advertising is casting a wide net, our strategy is to launch thousands of laser-guided missiles, directed by GPS coordinates with pinpoint precision. Pretty cool, right? We think so too.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h4>Location</h4>

<p><b>Blueprinting</b><br><br>


<div class="post-banner" align="left">

<img src="../img/blogImages/mobileAdvertising/shutterstock_199141433.jpg" align="center" alt="auburn haired woman in a white dress smiling with eyes closed in front of grey wall"><br><br> </div>

Let’s get away from the fish talk. You don’t want to cook and eat your audience, you want them to become converting customers.</p>

<p>When we blueprint an area, we’re not building physical infrastructure. Rather, we’re building an informational infrastructure. This means we can know exactly when someone is within walking distance of your business, entering your building, or even at a competitor’s place of business. These are just a few basic examples of how we can track the choices your audience is making.

<p>Blueprinting is by far the most accurate way to target audiences based on location. By blueprinting an area, we can use On Premise Targeting. This is exactly what it sounds like - targeting potential or current customers based on their exact location. With On Premise Targeting, you can be sure you're not wasting one penny targeting areas that may be out of reach or irrelevant which is often seen with geo targeting technology.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Proximity Targeting</b><br>

Putting up fences to reach more people? The future is weird.</p>

<p>By geo-fencing an area - say, a defined radius around your business - you can send targeted mobile ads to people nearby. By letting people know they’re a short walk away, and by giving them the incentive to pop in, you can see more foot traffic.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works: a potential customer walks inside the geo-fence, they receive the targeted ad on their mobile phone, they receive value and you receive a new customer. </p>

<br>
<p><b>Neighborhoods</b></br>

Another way to decide where your ads are being seen. You can define specific boundaries for easily scalable custom targeting in conjunction with proximity targeting and blueprinting.</p>

<p>Say a significant portion of the audience you're tracking consistently makes their way back to a certain area or neighborhood. You can define a neighborhood to target everyone in that vicinity who meets conditions you set based on behavior.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h4>Audience</h4>

<p>

<div class="post-banner" align="left">
<img src="../img/blogImages/mobileAdvertising/shutterstock_551148928.jpg" align="center" alt="three smiling women covered with bath towels laying back on a bed"><br><br></div>


Of course, just because someone is walking past your place of business doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll be interested.  Using a combination of demographic information, visitation patterns, and behavior, you can easily build lists of highly targetable users.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Location Audiences</b><br>

These are audiences built based on people who have visited specific brands or categories within a define time range of up to 90 days. For example, if an audience member has visited Target, Walmart, and Kmart; they could be placed into a “Mass merch” audience category.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Behavioral Audiences</b><br>

Behavioral audiences use a combination of visitation data and demographic information. As a specific example, we can see if women between the ages of 25-45 are making daily visits to an elementary school and a soccer field - effectively placing them in the Soccer Mom audience.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Custom Audiences</b><br>

These lists can then be managed as custom audiences, filtering segments based on any combination of but not limited to visitation data, behavioral attributes, demographic details, and purchase information.</p>

<p>This is all to say: you’ll never be wasting money on mistargeted advertising again!</p>

<p>This is all just the tip of the iceberg. Further tricks at your disposal will include full-blown location analytics data, and more advanced targeting techniques, such as weather targeting. (Sending out a special coupon on a rainy day, for example).</p>
