<h4><b>Why</b> digital marketing is important</h4>

<br>

<p>Times are changing, and we have to change with them. If we want to keep up with the latest trends in marketing, we have to evolve our business strategies. Gone are the days of relying on print ads and word of mouth to bring in business - we’ve moved into the digital realm.</p>

<p>More people than ever are now making their buying decisions online, and with the ubiquity of the internet, this trend shows no signs of slowing down. The good news is that with access to the latest tools and strategies, you have more power, control, and options than ever when it comes to marketing your business.</p>

<p>Digital marketing allows you to build a new audience while maintaining your current one, all the while providing value and relevant content that will show people your business is the one to choose.</p>

<p>Digital marketing also gives you access to analytics - an extremely important part of any marketing strategy! With analytics for your ad campaigns, website, social media and more, you can begin to make decisions based on hard facts rather than gut feelings.</p>

<br>

<h4><b>How</b> does digital marketing work?</h4>

<br>

<p>There’s a lot that falls under the umbrella of digital marketing, but generally speaking, it’s how you grow and maintain your online presence while helping yourself be found by new customers.</p>

<p>There are two main measurable methods of growth - <b>organic</b>, and <b>paid</b>.</p>

<br>

<div class="post-banner" align="center">

<img src="../img/blogImages/digitalMarketingPro/shutterstock_710318833.jpg" align="center" alt="auburn hair woman in a white sweater with hair over her eye"></div>

<br>


<p>There’s no need to overthink it! For the most part, these methods are exactly what they sound like. Organic growth is tied to how many people are finding and soliciting your business organically, based on finding you through search engines, social media, or other methods.</p>

<p>The king of organic growth is SEO (Search Engine Optimization). In a nutshell, a good SEO strategy, will help potential customers find your website or social media through a variety of strategies such as optimizing keywords, properly tagging your content, and making sure your information is disseminated correctly.</p>

<p>Paid growth is measured in customers you’re bringing in through methods such as digital ads or boosted social media posts. Paid growth has made great strides since the advent of digital marketing - no longer random banner ads on website, digital ads can now be targeted to specific audiences based on a plethora of criteria to ensure you’re not wasting a dime. There are a lot of options for paid growth, but it’s more straightforward than you might think.</p>

<p>There’s a lot that falls under the umbrella of digital marketing, but generally speaking, it’s how you grow and maintain your online presence while helping yourself be found by new customers<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Two methods of growth - organic, and paid</li>
<li>Consistent content relevant to your user base</li>
<li>Special offers/incentive for new and returning customers</li>
<li>Up to date/accurate information about your business</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h4><b>Where</b> do I apply digital marketing?</h4>

<br>

<p>Market on every facet of your online presence - and try to make your online presence as large as possible!</p>

<p>Starting with social media, try to produce constant quality content for your followers on a consistent basis. Shares and likes are the new forms of “word of mouth” marketing - the more relevant content you’re putting out there, the more likely people are to share your profile with their friends.</p>

<p>When it comes to digital ads, display ads on Google are always a safe bet. These ads are displayed only to those most likely to click on them and thus bring you business. The beauty of these ads is that over time, with more data based on who’s clicking, the targeting becomes even more refined and effective.</p>

<p>Mobile ads are also a big market. Most everyone is on their phones for hours a day, and these types of ads take advantage of that fact.

<p>Digital marketing doesn’t stop when someone reaches your website! For people to remain engaged with your brand, you need to offer up to date content and make them want to convert. We recommend constant blog post updates with content relevant to your desired audience.</p>

<p>Artfully designed banners promoting special offers or products, holiday updates to your site’s design, and videos people can easily watch also go a long way towards keeping people interested enough to spend time on your website.</p>
