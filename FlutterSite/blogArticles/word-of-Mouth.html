<p>Do you see now how online word of mouth can affect your business in a tremendously positive way?</p>

<br>
<br>

<h4>How does online word-of-mouth marketing work?</h4>

<p style="text-decoration:underline;">Advantage of online reviews<p>

<p>On Facebook business pages, customers can leave reviews that will be visible to other users. As Facebook is the biggest social network where most people use their real name, these reviews will be seen as trustworthy by other users even if they do not know the person. Indeed, <a href="https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/84-percent-of-people-trust-online-reviews-as-much-.html" target="_blank">84% of customers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations.</a> Moreover, when somebody consults your hair salon page, their friends’ reviews will appear at the top, making it easy for them to check their acquaintances' opinions about you. It’s a simple equation: the more reviews you have, and the better they are, the better the impression on potential customers.</p>

<br>

<p style="text-decoration:underline;">How can I promote my salon on social media?</p>

<p>People like to document the “highlights” of their lives and to show themselves looking good. After leaving your salon, some of them will choose to take a selfie of their fresh new haircut and share it on Instagram. You should encourage this, while also trying to make sure they use a hashtag that’s personal to your salon. Their photo will be seen by their followers attracts potential customers to your page when their friends click your link.</p>

<p><img src="../img/blogImages/wordMouth/promoteSalon.jpg" alt="yellow background with a drawing of a man and a woman talking with empty speech bubbles" align="right" width="350"></p>

<br>

<p>On Instagram and Facebook, you can create intriguing posts that online users can interact with by leaving comments on it. You can create a post that would prompt your audience to tag their friends in it thus making yourself more visible.</p>


<p style="text-decoration:underline;">How to get reviews on Facebook</p>
<p>Facebook has a tool that enables users to highlight the fact that they are looking for recommendations to their circle of friends by displaying a map where other users can pinpoint the business they want to recommend. Users directly ask their circle of friends to recommend them a place which will then be displayed visibly on the map and in the comments.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h4>Why word-of-mouth is key for your hair salon?</h4>


<p align="left">As a business, you always have to find new ways to attract new customers to engage with you as your current ones can move away, change their spending habits, and so on. <br>
Most of the time, customers become long-term ones because your hair salon has been recommended to them by a family member or friend. Indeed, people trust the opinion of their loved ones more than any other kind of advertising.</p>

<img src="../img/blogImages/wordMouth/megaphone.jpg" alt="green blue background with a red and blue megaphone peeking out of a circle projecting icons and objects with the words digital marketing under it" width="400" align="right">

<p>A new marketing strategy through word-of-mouth has now appeared by recommendations made by influencers. Brands reach out to influencers for them to try out their products or services, then recommend them to their online following.
